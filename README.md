### Hello! I'm Arya, a self taught programmer. 👋
- I am a Software Engineer with a 3+ years professional experience, and 7+ total years programming experience. I have a history developing data integrations for inter & intra-company solutions, with additional experience developing systems for both internal and external user-facing tooling and applications.
- Most of my personal projects revolve around 3rd party API tools for video games, as well as integrations using the Discord API to chatbots there.
- I enjoy contributing to other projects, especially working on thorough documentation and user guides for packages.

<br />

- 🛠️ Primary Tools: C#, Python, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
- ⚙️ Additional Tools: JavaScript, Rust, AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, MongoDB, MySQL
- 🔭 I’m currently working at the [OnePoint Patient Care](https://www.oppc.com/) creating and maintaining pharmacy data integration solutions.
- 🌱 I'm always seeking new opportunities to learn something new and teach others what I know.
- 📜 My #1 skill is my adaptability: I can learn and apply anything I need to very quickly.
